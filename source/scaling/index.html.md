Nanobox is designed to make scaling your app's infrastructure simple. You have the ability to scale your app in multiple ways, each triggered through your Nanobox dashboard. Nanobox takes care of all the "heavy-lifing" behind the scenes.

The next few docs provide information on how to scale, when to scale, different scaling strategies, and other important information to help ensure your app is able to meet demand.
