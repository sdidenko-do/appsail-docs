## System Requirements

- Windows 10+
- _Nanobox may be able to run on Windows 7 and 8, but it is not tested, nor officially supported._

Other system requirements depend on how you're going to run Nanobox. You can either use a lightweight VM (VirtualBox) or Native Docker.

### Lightweight VM (VirtualBox)
- VirtualBox - _A version of the [Nanobox installer](#download-amp-run-nanobox-installer) includes VirtualBox._
- Hyper-V **disabled**

### Native Docker
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
- Hyper-V **enabled**

## Download & Run Nanobox Installer
Download the Nanobox installer from the [Nanobox downloads page](https://dashboard.nanobox.io/download). Run it and it will walk you through the entire installation process.

_**Note:** If you plan on going with the lightweight VM option and already have VirtualBox installed, you can select the "Use Docker Native" option. This will download an installer that only includes the Nanobox executable._

## Run & Setup Nanobox
The first time you run any [Nanobox command](/cli/), it will walk you through an initial setup process to configure things like RAM, CPU, and other things related to your local environment.

## Start Hacking!
With Nanobox installed, our [Getting Started Guides](https://guides.nanobox.io) walk you through getting popular languages and frameworks up and running with Nanobox.
