## Download the Mako Package - TODO update the links
Download the Mako package appropriate for your Linux distribution from the [Mako downloads page](https://dashboard.nanobox.io/download). Unpack and install the package as you normally install packages in your specific distro.

## Run & Setup Mako
The first time you run Mako [`push`](/cli/) command, it will walk you through an initial setup process to authenticate the cli into your DigitalOcean account.

## Start Building!
With Mako installed, the [Getting Started Guides](https://guides.nanobox.io) walk you through getting popular languages and frameworks up and running with Mako.
