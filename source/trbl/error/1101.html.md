## The Issue
Nanobox has ordered a host on your provider, but the status has never been set to active.

## Potential Causes
- The server is still provisioning.
- The server order process has hit its maximum number of retries to connect to the host and is no longer attempting.

## Steps to Take

### Check with Your Hosting Provider
Check your server's ordering status to ensure the process is still moving along. The time it takes to order and provision a new server depends on your provider. There may also be an issue that's holding the process up. Contact your hosting provider for more information.

### Retry the Process
Once the issue has been resolved, retry the process. The retry button is available in your dashboard, to the right of the error information.
