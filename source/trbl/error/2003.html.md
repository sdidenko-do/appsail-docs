## The Issue
The docker image specified in your boxfile.yml doesn't exist.

## Possible Causes
- The image path used in your boxfile.yml is wrong.

## Steps to Take
There are two possible solutions to this issue that require slightly different steps:

[Update the image path in your boxfile.yml](#update-the-image-path-in-your-boxfile-yml)  
[Update the image path on Docker Hub](#update-the-image-path-on-docker-hub)  

### Update the Image Path in Your boxfile.yml
If you choose to update the image path in your boxfile.yml, do the following:

1. Cancel the erred process
2. Update your boxfile.yml
3. Deploy the updated boxfile.yml

### Update the Image Path on Docker Hub
If you don't want to change the image path specified in your boxfile.yml and you have administrative rights to the image on Docker Hub, you can change the location on Docker Hub to match the path specified in your boxfile.yml. To do this, do the following:

1. Update the image path on Docker Hub
2. Retry the Process by clicking the "Retry" Button.
