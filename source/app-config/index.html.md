Every app is unique and App Sail strives to detect all of the configuration details. But sometimes developers need to be able to configure their environment to their app's specific needs. With App Sail, environment configuration is centralized in a single file - your `appsail.yml`.

The next few docs walk through the specifics of the config file as well as other things to consider when building your apps:

[Runtime & Services](/app-config/runtime-services/)  
[Environment Variables](/app-config/environment-variables/)  
[Adding Packages](/app-config/adding-packages/)  
[Application Logs](/app-config/app-logs/)  
[Network Storage](/app-config/network-storage/)  
[Writable Directories](/app-config/writable-dirs/)  
[Cron Jobs](/app-config/cron-jobs/)  
[Build & Deploy Hooks](/app-config/build-deploy-hooks/)
