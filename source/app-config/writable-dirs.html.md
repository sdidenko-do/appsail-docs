### UPDATE - NEEDS REVIEW BY ENGINEERS

Code components created through Nanobox are read-only, but in some cases, it may be necessary to enable writable permissions in a directory without storing that directory in [network storage](/app-config/network-storage/). Writable directories allow you to enable writable permissions on directories in your web and worker instances’ local filesystems.

### What is a Writable Directory
A writable directory is a directory stored in your instances’ local filesystem with writable permissions. Because they are stored locally in each instance, their contents do not persist between deploys or when the instance is decommissioned.

### How Are They Different Than Network Directories?
Writable directories and Network Directories are very similar, but have two key differences.

- Writable directories are stored in your instances’ local filesystems and are unique to each instance. Network directories are stored in a network storage service and shared between all instances.

- The contents of writable directories are flushed on each deploy. The contents of network directories persist between deploys.

## Configuring Writable Directories

Writable directories are available to webs & workers and are configured in your Boxfile. On deploy, these directories are replaced with *empty*, writable directories. Filepaths should be relative to the root of your repo.

#### writable\_dirs
```yaml
web.site:
  writable_dirs:
    - path/to/dirA
    - path/to/dirB
```

#### Nested Directories Will Be Ignored
When specifying `writable_dirs` in your Boxfile, you shouldn't list “nested” directories. For example: dirA and dirA/nested-dir. While the writable permissions are recursive, only the parent directory will be honored and the nested subdirectories will not be created.

#### Writable Dirs Can't be Inside of Network Dirs
When defining `writable_dirs`, be sure the directory you define is not inside of a `network_dir`. All network directories are stored in a storage service and files within them cannot be saved to the local filesystem of instances.

## Things To Know

### Do Not Persist Between Deploys
Writable directories do not persist between deploys. These directories are in each instances’ local filesystem and are decommissioned with the instance. They should only be used for transient data such as cache, temporary files, etc.

### Faster than Network Directories
Because writable directories are a part of each instance’s local filesystem, they are much faster than network directories. Network directories are housed in an external service and accessed across the network, adding some latency.

### Limited to Service’s Local Disk Size
The amount of code/data that can be stored in writable directories is limited to the disk size of your web or worker instance(s).

## Recommended Uses

### Static Asset Caching
Writable directories are a great solution for caching static assets. The files are local, so reads and writes are fast. Caches are built organically as requests hit each instance. Also, there is no chance of multiple instances trying to write to the same cache file and interrupting network storage connections.

#### Priming Caches on Deploy
If using `before_live` or `after_live` hooks to prime your cache on deploy, these commands will only run on one of your service’s instances. In services with more than one instance, you should use `before_live_all` and `after_live_all` hooks to run the command on all instances.
