As you're developing locally, changes to your code, runtime, and infrastructure are expected. This doc walks through things you should now, and in some cases, how to apply those changes to your app.

## Changes to Your appsail.yml
Your appsail.yml defines your app's runtime, configuration, and architecture and changes to it are applied through building a new runtime and deploying the runtime into your App Sail environments. This file is automatically generated and managed by the CLI and can be found in your `<SRC DIR>/.appsail/deploy` folder. For most use cases you shouldn't have to manually update it. The `sail push` command will detect any changes to your appsail.yml and automatically rebuild your runtime. In case you need to manually change it, simply run the `push` command from your `<SRC DIR>` to apply changes.

```bash
# start your local app using the new runtime
sail push
```

## Changes to Application Code
We will be adding a full support for local dev workflow very soon. Until then, if you wish to develop and test your code locally without having to push to App Sail environments and without configuring your local environment, follow [this guide](/workflow/dry-run). Once you are ready to deploy to App Sail, just run the `push` command again and all changes will be immediately applied to your running app with no downtime.
