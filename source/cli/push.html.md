The `run` is the primary command used for running your app locally. By running the `run` command, Nanobox will provision a local environment using the codebase in the current working directory. Once provisioned, it will drop you into an interactive console inside the isolated environment.

You can also pass a command into the `run` command. This will run the specified command inside your running local environment and stream output to your console.

### Usage
```bash
# Pattern
nanobox run [<command>]

# Example
nanobox run rails s
```
