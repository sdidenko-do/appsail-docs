## Generating a New Auth Token
Your auth token is used to authenticate requests to the Nanobox API. It is important that you keep your auth token secure. If your token is ever compromised, immediately generate a new one by going to Account Admin > Info and scrolling down to your Auth Token. Click the "Regenerate" Button.
